LINCS needed to be restructured with modern technical architecture into a secure, streamlined platform where education practitioners could enjoy learning and sharing. LINCS users also needed reliable, friendly support to resolve technical and login issues and get back to helping adult learners.","tags":["Support","Drupal","Quality Assurance"],"specs":["Drupal 7","JIRA Service Desk","Moodle Learning Management System","FedRAMP compliant platform","Mobile-friendly, responsive design","Shibboleth Single Sign On","Docker","Ansible"],"images":[{"caption":"Presenting findings from discovery about LINCS user needs","alt":"LINCS Home page","url":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/LINCS1-469ff5b1442001b7d8c01fd7449e406e-25c95.jpg"}}}},{"caption":"Visitors to the LINCS website can quickly find the resources they need","alt":"CivicActions meets with LINCS team and partners","url":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/LINCS2-a39956c2a0531be03e1501d6cc701b13-25c95.jpg"}}}}]}}},"pageContext":{}}
