{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<hr>\n<h2>Hello!</h2>\n<p>This is the first case study.\nTrump’s policy of separating refugee children from parents does not end in detention centers, it begins in them. As time goes on, more and more reports will emerge: children have already been taken from detention centers and flown across the country. Secretary Besty DeVos’s family is intimately connected Bethany Christian Services, one of the foster systems that has been rehoming children. At least 81 children who have been taken from their parents at the border have so far been fostered out by this Evangelical organization.</p>\n<p>The left-wing group The Other 98% has called this a “state-sponsored kidnapping.” They aren’t wrong. Children sent to detention camps and then carted off to foster families across the country are unlikely to be able to return to the families they were torn away from. Many of them will inevitably end up like Carlos — their names and languages will be changed, they will be kept from mothers, fathers, cousins, aunts, or uncles.</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/case-studies/case-study-1","title":"The first case study"}}},"pageContext":{"jsonName":"case-studies-case-study-1-f66","internalComponentName":"ComponentCaseStudiesCaseStudy1","path":"/case-studies/case-study-1","component":"/Users/civicactions/Documents/Online Classes/civicactions/src/templates/caseStudyTemplate.js","componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-case-study-template-js","context":{},"updatedAt":1531411355682,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin default-site-plugin","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin default-site-plugin","componentPath":"/Users/civicactions/Documents/Online Classes/civicactions/src/templates/caseStudyTemplate.js"}}
